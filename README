Software installation
Install Java
Openbravo POS is an application developed in Java and to execute it you will need the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or greater.

On Windows
You can install Java from Sun's website.

On Ubuntu
To install java in Ubuntu make sure to have the multiverse and restricted repositories activated. To do this you can add the following lines to the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://za.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted
deb http://za.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid multiverse
Where intrepid is the Ubuntu version you have installed. And after modified you have to update your repository executing:

sudo apt-get update 
And to install java execute

sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-fonts
You can also add the multiverse repository using the system tool Software sources, and install the java packages using the Synaptic package manager.

To verify that the correct version of java is installed the following command can be used:

java -version
If you have more than one java environment installed in your machine you need to select the Sun java runtime environment (JRE) 1.6 or greater. The following command can be used to list the available java versions:

update-java-alternatives -l
And to change from one version to another, the following command can be used:

sudo update-java-alternatives -s <JRE Version>
Download and install Openbravo POS
Download the latest version of the Openbravo POS from Sourceforge. There are available installers for several operating systems and architectures or as a binary package. There is a description of all the files available for download in the Openbravo POS 2.30 Release notes#How to get Openbravo POS.

The installers are very simple to follow and the binary package just needs to be opened with your favourite uncompressor and extract all files to an empty folder.

Run it!
The first time Openbravo POS starts and there isn't a database, it display a warning alerting that it has found an empty database. If you click OK, Openbravo POS will create for you the database structure necessary to run.

On Windows
Installer
Go to Start -> Applications -> Openbravo POS -> Openbravo POS

Binary package
Execute the file start.bat just double clicking on it or launch from the command line. You can also create a shortcut to this file and place it in your preferred location: the desktop, the launch bar...

On Linux
Installer
In Gnome go to Applications -> Office -> Openbravo POS or just execute openbravopos command in a command line.

Binary Package
Execute sh start.sh.

In linux you first need to add execution permissions to the files start.sh and configure.sh to do this execute the following commands:

chmod +x start.sh 
chmod +x configure.sh 

On MacOSX
Open the Apple Terminal (located at: /Applications/Utilities) and go with the command line to the location the start.sh file is located. Then execute sh start.sh.

Localization packages installation
If you want to have Openbravo POS in your language you need first to download the localization package suitable for your language. The list of available localization packages and where to download is maintained in the Openbravo POS localization guide.

Localization packages are very simple to install, just uncompress the localization package in the same folder Openbravo POS is installed and restart the application.

Database installation
Once Openbravo POS is installed you should decide whether you want to run Openbravo POS on the built-in engine or on any of the other database engines supported. Openbravo POS supports five database engines: Apache Derby, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and HSQLDB.

Openbravo POS since version 2.30 uses by default Apache Derby for data storage. Apache Derby is bundled with the binary package of Openbravo POS and offers the advantage that it doesn't have to be configured, and it is reliable and robust enough for most requirements.

Apache Derby
Openbravo POS is distributed with the embedded library of Apache Derby so if you plan to use Apache Derby in embedded mode you do not need to download or install anything. Using Embedded mode makes the database single concurrent user. Only one OpenbravoPOS can access it at a time. You need to stop OpenbravoPOS to access the database with IJ, SquirrelSQL, OpenOffice or other tools. If you want to use Apache Derby in client/server mode you need to download and install the full distribution of Apache Derby available from the Apache Derby web site, or install from repository. In client server mode you can access the database concurrently from several applications or workstations.

Derby is called javadb by Sun, and is included in Ubuntu from 7.04 onwards.

sudo apt-get install sun-java6-javadb
To test access with the Derby command line client, called ij

cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/bin
export DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/bin
./ij
connect 'jdbc:derby:/home/myuser/openbravopos-database;create=true';
show tables;
select * from resources;
An example of a database configuration using Apache Derby as database engine in embedded mode is:

Driver library: derby.jar
Driver class: org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
URL: jdbc:derby:/home/myuser/openbravopos-database;create=true
User: yourname
Password: yourpass
And in client / server mode:

Driver library: derbyclient.jar
Driver class: org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver
URL: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/openbravopos-database;create=true
User: yourname
Password: yourpass
Note if you take a working Embedded database directory, such as the default openbravopos-database, and change to accessing it in client / server mode, the user must be APP and password does not matter, unless you set Java security.

User: APP
Password: whatever-but-not-blank
An example snip from openbravopos.properties

# your install directory below may vary
db.driverlib=/opt/openbravopos-2.30/lib/derbyclient.jar
db.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver
db.URL=jdbc:derby://localhost:1527//home/openbravopos/openbravopos-database
db.user=APP
db.password=b
You need to start the Derby server

# Start Derby in server mode
export DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db
# setup the classpath so Derby knows where to find itself
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/bin/setNetworkServerCP
# -h = host  interface to listen on, 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces
# this means you can access the database from other machines on the network
# & at the end means spawn this process and return to the prompt
java -jar /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/lib/derbynet.jar start -h 0.0.0.0 &
# in the derby:// connect string you need to give the full path to the openbravo-database directory
You also need to ensure derbyclient.jar is available.

On Ubuntu
In Lucid it can be found in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/lib/derbyclient.jar.

OpenOffice
Using OpenOffice base enables you to visualize your data, write reports and queries. Be careful if you choose to alter data, you can easily break internal links or sequences between records or tables.

To access your OpenbravoPOS data from OpenOffice, in client server mode

First tell OO where the Derby jar can be found

Tools..Options..Java..Class Path...
Add Archive
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/db/lib/derbyclient.jar
Then connect to the database

New database
Connect to an existing database JDBC
Datasource URL:  derby://localhost:1527//home/openbravopos/openbravopos-database
JDBC driver class:  org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver
File save database file, give it a local name, like openbravopos.odb

Make sure you've started the Derby server, as described above.

To make the tables available to OO Calc

Tools..Options..OpenOffice.org Base..Databases
New...Database file..Browse..OpenbravoPOS.odb  (if thats what you saved it as above)
Registered name.. openbravopos (any logical name will do)
In Calc

Data..Data Pilot..Start
Data source registered in OpenOffice.org
Database..OpenbravoPOS (from above)
Data source (choose a table eg) APP.PRODUCTS
Type Sheet
ok
Data retrieval may take a few moments.

MySQL
On Windows
Download MySQL server (essentials package recommended) and install it.

Download MySQL Connector/J, unzip the contents and place it in the same folder where Openbravo POS resides.

Alternatively you can install MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser MySQL GUI Tools Downloads.

On Ubuntu
Activate the universe repository and run following commands in a terminal:

sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysql-java
You can also install MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser:

sudo apt-get install mysql-admin mysql-query-browser
Connector/J is on /usr/share/java/mysql.jar. You can copy or link it to Openbravo POS' folder.

Usage
Create an user and a database (schema).

You can check MySQL documentation.

An example of a database configuration using MySQL as database engine is:

Driver library: mysql-connector-java-3.1.6-bin.jar
Driver class: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbravopos
User: yourname
Password: yourpass
Note: if you copy/paste these values, make sure you do not have a blank space at the end of each string, i.e. "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver ", this will cause an error when executing Openbravo.

For used non-Latin symbols, you need add support UTF-8 for MySQL database connect. Example:

URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbravopos?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&characterSetResults=UTF-8
PostgreSQL
To use Openbravo POS with PostgreSQL you must have a PostgreSQL server running and the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL.

On Windows
Download the server PostgreSQL download and install it.

Download the JDBC driver PostgreSQL JDBC Driver according to your version and install it.

You can also install the PosgreSQL administration tool pgAdminIII.

On Ubuntu
Ensure you have the universe repository activated and run following commands in a terminal:

sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.2 libpg-java
You can also install the administrator tool pgAdmin3:

sudo apt-get install pgadmin3
The JDBC lib is on /usr/share/java/postgresql.jar. You can copy or link it to Openbravo POS' folder.

Usage
After the database server is installed and running you have to create an empty database for Openbravo POS and a database user with privileges to connect to this database. You can check PostgreSQL documentation.

An example of a database configuration using PostgreSQL as database engine is:

Driver library: /usr/share/java/postgresql-8.0.309.jdbc3.jar    
Driver class: org.postgresql.Driver  
URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openbravopos
User youruser  
Password: youpass
Oracle
To use Openbravo POS with Oracle you must have an Oracle server running and the JDBC driver for Oracle.


On Windows
Download and install Oracle XE and the JDBC Driver.

You can also install to administer and query the database Oracle JDeveloper.

On Ubuntu
Download and install Oracle XE and the JDBC Driver.

You can also install to administer and query the database Oracle JDeveloper.

Usage
After the database server is installed and running you have to create an empty database for Openbravo POS and a database user with privileges to connect to this database.

An example of database configuration is:

Driver library: ojdbc14.jar
Driver class: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
User youruser  
Password: youpass
